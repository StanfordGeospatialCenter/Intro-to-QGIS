#Introduction to QGIS


####Stacey Maples – Geospatial Manager – Stanford Geospatial Center – <stacemaples@stanford.edu>
####David Medeiros – GIS Instruction & Support Specialist  - Stanford Geospatial Center - <davidmed@stanford.edu> 
This introductory session will focus upon the fundamental concepts and skills needed to begin using Geographic Information Systems software for the exploration and analysis of spatial data using the ArcGIS platform.  Topics will include: 

* What is GIS? 
* Spatial Data Models and Formats
* Projections and Coordinate Systems
* Basic Data Management
* The QGIS User Interface 
* Simple Analysis using Visualization  

#GIS Resources:

##Download Tutorial Data
1. In a browser, go to [https://stanford.box.com/SGCIntroGIS](https://stanford.box.com/SGCIntroGIS) and click on the drop-down arrow to the right of each folder to download individual datasets. Save the Dataset(s) to your Desktop.
2. Right-click on the resulting *.zip file and select **Extract All…**
3. Accept all defaults to extract the data file.


##Open QGIS and Explore the User Interface
QGIS is a Free and Open Source Geographic Information System software platform. It is an excellent alternative to proprietary platforms, like Esri's ArcGIS.  The first thing we want to do is Open QGIS and get familiar with the User Interface.  

1. In Windows, go to the Programs menu and find the QGIS Program Group, then select QGIS to Open QGIS.
2. On a Mac, go to your Applications folder and launch QGIS from there.
3. QGIS will launch with a new, blank Map Project file.

You should be presented with something like the interface you see below:

##The Basic Components of the QGIS Interface
The QGIS interface is made up of three basic components:   


##Enabling and Rearranging the User Interface/Toolbars


###Interacting with Tabbed Windows


###Explore the “Windows” (QGIS Browser)

  


###Finally, let’s open a Project File!


##The Data Frame and its Properties 


###Projections and Coordinate Systems in QGIS


###Change Coordinate System to GCS WGS 1984


##Explore Navigations Tools and Visibility in Data Frames

###Bookmarks

###Display Order

##Working with Layers & Their Properties

###Layer Visibility


###Selecting By Attributes


###Exporting Data


###Change City Symbology


###Label Cities


###Join a Table to a Layer 


###Definition Querys


###Symbolize Countries by Population Density


###Adding “Cloud” Data


##Layout Mode

###The Layout Mode Navigation Tools


###Resize Data Frame


##Adding Map Elements

###Legend

###Scale Bar

###Neat Line

###Exporting Your Map
